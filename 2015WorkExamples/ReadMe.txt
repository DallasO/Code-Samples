These files are from a couple projects from a company I worked for in 2015.

I worked as a contractor for a client, but their name was removed and replaced with another for
the purposes of keeping them anonymous as well as keeping the focus on my work.
I was the only one responsible for this work, and had to teach myself most of it.

PartnerInsightAccel.asp contains the most interesting work by using D3.js to create graphs generated
from the data gathered from the database. The other files are just to showcase some other and more general skills that I have.

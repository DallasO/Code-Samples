Here are some examples from a C++ course I took a few years ago. 

-The "programs"'s were actually written by me from start to finish.
-The "lab"'s were mostly pre-written, but had missing snippets of concepts that
 I filled in. These are where the comments include "DO_xx", where xx is the
 number of the problem.

Hello, and Welcome to my GitHub.

--I apologize now for not having the best structure to this, but I am
  new to GitHub and am testing it out all by myself--
  
  I am mostly using this resource as a way to provide code examples
  from my college career for any future reference I may need. I am
  also planning on using GitHub to help others with what I have to offer, 
  as well as learn from the community.
  
More about me:  I am an Information Systems graduate, with an emphasis in
                Systems Development, from the University of
                Wisconsin-Eau Claire. I have graduated in
                December 2014, after which I have moved to Reno, NV.

More about the Code:  I will be posting assignments from the courses
                      I have taken in college. And even though I am
                      not allowed to post code from my internship
                      (with Menard, Inc.; because it is a private
                      company and its against their policy), I will
                      try to use what I have learned from there to
                      answer questions about the Progress(Now OpenEdge)
                      language that I find on GitHub.

                      
Thank you for taking the time to look at some of what I have done,
and please check back often, as I will be adding comments to some
of the examples, as well as adding more examples.

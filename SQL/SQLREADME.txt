The file "DallasSQLExample.sql" is from a huge group project that I was a part of in
the spring of 2014. The only big assignment we did was work on this project. We designed
it for the local Boys and Girls Club in our area. We were responsible for doing
everything, from contacting them with our questions and sending updates to make sure we
were going in the right direction. The final project included the SQL file and an Entity
Relationship Diagram for the whole database.

We were in a team of 4, and I was with one person I have had other classes with, and
I have had none of them in a programming class. It was a fun experience (and long
hours in the library working together), and it was worth it. From talking with the
professor, it sounded like we had one of the better projects in the class. We
didn't get too bad of a grade, and ended with 2332 lines of code!

I included most of the parts that I did. I also helped to correct things of my group
members', including table creates and coming up with all the insert data. We needed to 
have a basically functioning database with data, and we needed to have at least 10
records for each table, and there could be as little repeating as possible. Tables
like phone, email, and person ended with about 30 records each!
